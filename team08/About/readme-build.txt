To build the software, navigate the Build folder, within the candleSim folder, and run candle-simulator.exe.

The build file does not contain the entire Unity repo because the prefabs and materials we used for the project are very large files and wouldn't fit in Canvas.
It does however contain all the scripts, scenes, all candle assets, and sound we used.
